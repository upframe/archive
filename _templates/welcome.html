    <p style="color: #212121; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 0;">Hi {{ .Name }},</p>

    <p>I’m happy to tell you that you were accepted to join our Pre-Acceleration Programme 🚀🎉💪</p>

    <p>You will have the opportunity to meet energetic young people and absorb the knowledge of experienced mentors!<p>

    <p>Now that you are only one step away to become part of the Upframe family, you should get to know who the other members are. I’m Henrique, Malik’s mate and Upframe Co-Founder. I’m sure we’ll have plenty of opportunities to meet and talk a bit, so add me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/henriquemsfialho" target="_blank">Facebook</a>!</p>

    <p>As I said, there is only one small step left to be made: the payment for the registration must be done. The transfer will be done through Paypal, and you must complete it within 5 days. Otherwise, we will have to give your spot to other participant.</p>

    <p>Simply follow this <a href="https://upframe.co/pay?email={{ .Email }}" target="_blank">link</a> and we will get back to you after the payment is confirmed!</p>

    <p>We are so proud to welcome you as a part of our family 😁</p>

    <p>Cheers,<br>
      Henrique Fialho (<a style="color: #00e5d4;" href="https://m.me/henriquemsfialho" target="_blank">@henriquefialho</a>)
